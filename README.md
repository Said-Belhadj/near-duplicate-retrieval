# near-duplicate-retrieval
This project aims to develop a robust model for near-duplicate image retrieval, focusing on identifying images originating from the same source. The primary objective is to trace the trajectory of images within the context of war history and propaganda. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the model will be capable of efficiently identifying and retrieving images that share common origins, shedding light on the paths through which these images propagate. Through meticulous analysis, this project seeks to unveil the intricate networks and channels through which images traverse, providing insights into their historical significance and propagandistic narratives.
